Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project
By this project, a tidy dataset need to be created from the existing data sets for the data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone.
 R script run_analysis.R is coded, which will perform the following activities
•	Download the datasets from the given URL.
•	Load both the existing datasets training and test.
•	Will keep only the required columns which are used to calculate mean and standard deviation.
•	Will give understandable names for the activities in the dataset.
•	Merges required columns in dataset.
•	Merges the two datasets to create a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each activity and each subject combination.

Final tidy data set is named as Tidydata.txt
Codebook.md is created and available in project repo which is used to understand variables along with their units and other required information.
